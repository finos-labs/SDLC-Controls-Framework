In today’s highly regulated technology landscape, the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) must be executed with rigor, discipline, and with increasing focus on compliance. Organizations are increasingly required to demonstrate adherence to governance frameworks, regulatory standards, and internal risk management policies.

To meet these expectations, SDLC processes must incorporate robust controls that not only ensure product quality and security but also provide clear evidence of compliance. However, many teams struggle with identifying which risks are most critical and how best to mitigate them consistently across projects.

This project aims to present a curated set of common risks encountered during the SDLC, along with their corresponding mitigations. By establishing a standardized library of controls, the goal is to streamline compliance efforts, reduce uncertainty, and promote safe, repeatable development practices aligned with regulatory expectations.
