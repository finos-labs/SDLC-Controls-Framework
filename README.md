# SDLC Controls Framework

The purpose of this working group is to establish a common controls catalogue for software governance across financial institutions to increase reuse, reduce toil and provide additional clarity through consistency.

This repository contains the documentation and website, generated via Jekyll.


## Running Jekyll

You will need Ruby and `bundle` installed, then run the site locally using the following.

```sh
cd docs
bundle install
jekyll serve
```

If all goes well, view your freshly minted site at http://127.0.0.1:4000. It should 'hot reload' (Jekyll does its thing) so you can edit and see your changes in the browser.
